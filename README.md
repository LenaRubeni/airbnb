## Udacity - Airbnb dataset

This repository contains my work in the scope of the Udacity Nanodegree Programm *Data Scientist*.

The first project looks at the AirBnB Open Data Seattle Dataset. In the scope of the project, I work through the CRISP-DM Process.

The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle.


The code is in the format of a jupyter notebook and can be accessed accordingly. In the notebook I try to answer three questions concerning the dataset. The notebook contains a detailed description of the steps I take towards answering these questions as well as information about the ways in which I analyzed the data. 

This repository only contains the notebook and the README file.

# Conclusion

From the dataset I generated the following insights:

1. There is a busy season in Seattle that also corresponds to the price. There is high availability towards the end of the year and 
the price is highest during sommer season.

2. The price of Airbnnb apartments depends on the neighbourhood that one stays in. Most listings are in the central area of Seattle and the most expensive area is Magnolia. 

3. For the features that I included into my predictio model especially the neighbourhood information seems to impact the value. Also number of bathrooms and bedrooms may indicate that you have to pay more.
